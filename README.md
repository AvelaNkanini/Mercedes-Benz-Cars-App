### Mercedes-Benz Vehicle Browser App

This project is a simple yet practical mobile app that lets users browse different types of Mercedes-Benz vehicles. It represents an important step in my mobile development journey, especially as I continue learning how to work with images and visual assets.

Mercedes-Benz has always been one of my dream companies, so building something that showcases their cars feels special. It brought me a little closer to that dream and gave me a real confidence boost.
